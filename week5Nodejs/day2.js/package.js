//                                PACKAGE
//            * It is a set of files bundled together to provide a specific functionality.
//                 It is a ready made tool used for project. Instead of creating by ourselves,we can install package to do the project.
//            * It usually comes with a package.json file that describes the package (its name, version, dependencies, etc.)

// Packages can be:

// 1) Built-in (fs, http)

// 2) External (express, lodash (installed from npm))

// They are reusable, versioned, and can be shared via npm (Node Package Manager).






// Where do packages come from?

      //  Ans:- They are published and downloaded from the npm registry (Node Package Manager).


// When we install a package,
//                  1. The code downloaded in a folder named node_modules.
//                  2. List of packages saved in package.json. 
//                  3. Now,can use in the project
