<!--               API:- Application  Programming Interface



* It is a middleman helps two programs or apps to communicate each other.
* http is protocol , whereas api is interface.
* what data should give decided by api. eg:-sum
* in otherwords, it is a function to handle 
* If we ask for a data, api send request to server and get it back to us.
* Eg:- weather API,Google Map, Instagram...We get corresponding information from the app with the help of API
* We can use API with help of URL and get the data back.:-


           fetch("https://fakestoreapi.com/products")
           .then(response=>response.json())
           .then(data => console.log(data))

*We dont need to know how the server works.
