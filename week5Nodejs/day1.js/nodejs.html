<!--                     What is Node.js?
        * It is a run time environment,allows to run js on server.
        * It is built on Google Chrome’s V8 engine.
        * Single programming language:- can write both frontend and backend in JavaScript
        * Event-driven and non-blocking.
        * Can generate dynamic page content.
        * Can create,open,read,write,delete and close files on the server.
        * Can collect form data.
        * Can add,delete,modify data in the database.
        * why Node.js is popular?
               * Because it is efficient
               * Very fast in code execution
        * Definition:- Node.js is an open-source,cross-platform,back-end js runtime environment that runs on the v8 engine and executes js code outside a web browser.

              -Javascript engine is a program whose responsibility is to execute js code.

* Browsers (like Chrome) can run JavaScript. It can only change the webpage

* But Node.js lets our computer run JavaScript like a server. It can also access files, create servers, connect to databases, etc.


* Node.js allows javascript to run outside the browser.
    *Used to build backend servers(APIs, web apps, file severs etc)





                                     KEY FEATURES



* Fast Execution (V8 Engine)  :-     Node.js is built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it **very fast** at running JavaScript code.                                    
* Non-blocking I/O (Asynchronous)  :-  It uses non-blocking (asynchronous) input/output. 
                                       * That means Node.js can handle **many requests at the same time** without waiting for one to finish. 
                                       
* Cross-platform   :-         Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
                                     *  so you can write code once and run it anywhere.     
                                     
                                     
* Single Threaded but Event-Driven :- Node.js uses a single thread with an event loop to handle multiple connections efficiently (ideal for real-time apps like chat).                  |

* Same Language (JavaScript) for Front & Back :- developers can use JavaScript on both the client side (browser) and server side — easier and faster development.                |

* NPM (Node Package Manager) :-  Node.js comes with NPM, a tool that allows  to install and use libraries (like Express, Mongoose, etc.) easily.  
                              
* File System Access :-  can read/write files, create folders, and access your local system using Node.js.   
                                          
* Node.js is a Open Source and Large Community:-  free to use and has a large community with lots of support, tutorials, and packages.            
                                           
* Real-time App Support:- like live chats, online games, and collaborative tools.  

* Built-in Modules:- has many built-in modules like http, fs, path, etc., so don’t always need third-party tools.                                        |

          * When we install Node.js, it already brings a toolkit filled with useful tools (called built-in modules) like:

                   *  http – to create a server

                   * fs – to read/write files

                   * path – to work with file paths

                   * url – to parse URLs

                   * os – to get info about your operating system
