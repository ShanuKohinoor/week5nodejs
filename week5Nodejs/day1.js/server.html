??      What is a Server

                                         SERVER

//A server is a software or hardware system that accepts requests from clients and sends back responses, usually over the internet or a local network.
    //it serves what we request


// A server is a computer,device or a program that shares data, network, and files etc to the other computer.
// It is a computer software provide service to other computers in local area network(LAN) or wide area network(WAN)
// It provides functionality for other networks called clients.
// Server computer is used for:-
//               * To share files with clients with required passwords.
//               * To manage network resources. 
//               * To share database.
//               * To share emails. 
//               * To share networ devices. 
//               * To connect other external devices such as printers etc.
//               * It also store,retrieve and send files to other computers.



// A server is just a computer that responds to requests from other devices (called clients), usually over a network (like the internet or local network).

// When you visit a website like google.com, your browser is a client, and Google's computer (server) sends the web page back to you.







                             //Types of server


//1.organization setup:- can access office only
       //to store office details..They have separate server room
       //cant access public
       //have common server:-All system of employees connected to this server





//2. Internet server:- Can publically access
   //Eg:- Facebook,youtube

          //  a.Web server:- to access website
          //  b.Mail server:- related to mail
          //  c.File server:-managing our sharing files etc




//Basically server is a computer
//We can use our normal computer as server by increasing its storage capacity -->

                               Localhost vs Remote Server

Localhost :- It is for development and testing.
              * Runs in our own computer. 
              * We can run our project on our computer before go for live.
              * We can only access.
              * No need of internet.
              * It is safe.
              * We can test code, fix bugs, and make changes without affecting real users.
              * Eg tools on Local host:- Node.js


              
Remote Server :- It is for deployement(live/production) 
                  * Our project,app etc can be hosted on a remote machine and anyone can access that.
                  * It can be far away.
                  * Need security measures to prevent hacking.
                  * Need internet.
                  * Anyone can access.
                  * Usually upload project using GitHub, Netlify etc.













                  What is a Port  (Default & Custom Ports)

 Port is a number used by our computer to talk with specific app.
 Our computer has only one IP address and it runs many apps. So with the help of port, incoming request handled to the specific app.
 We have many servers in a single computer. To identify that, use port. 
 Different port, listen different server.
 Port is a virtual door.


 const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end("Hello, this is my server!");
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000");
});







80	                   HTTP               	Websites without encryption
443	                   HTTPS	              Secure websites (with SSL/TLS encryption)
3000	                 Custom	              Common port for Node.js development servers
8080	                 Custom	              Alternative to port 80 (often used for testing)









                     What Kind of Requests Does a Server Receive?

    Answer:- HTTP request
          when we open a website and click a button, browser send a request to server. That is HTTP request.



 ◦ HTTP Request Basics  

       * HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests is like sending a message to server for asking something
       * It is the way browser and server communicate on the internet.
       * Request is a client(app or chrome) asks server to:-
             - Get data
             - Send data
             - Delete or update something

             Eg:- If we take browser and search https://www.instagram.com, browser send HTTP request to instagram server.
                  * instagram responds with HTML code,CSS,Javascript ,images ,posts etc...



       * Every HTTP request includes:-
                1. A method (what kind of action?)

                2. A URL (which resource?)

                3. Some headers (extra info)

                4. An optional body (actual data, only for some methods)






 ◦ Request Types (HTTP Methods)  

      1. GET :- To get data from the server.
                  * No change in data or body

                  Eg:- Get a blog post from 
                        GET /blog/10 -> Get post with ID 10.


      2. POST :- To send data to the server.
                 * Creates new data.

                  Eg:- POST/ sign up 
                        { "email": "test@example.com", "password": "1234" }


      3. PUT :- To upload or replace something completelety.
              * Replace old data.

                Eg:- PUT/user/5
                      { "name": "Shanu", "email": "shanu@example.com" }

                       *Here replace user 5's entire record.

      4. PATCH :- To partially  update existing data.
              * Change data.
              * Update specific field.

               Eg:- PATCH/user/5
                    { "email": "newemail@example.com" }

      5. DELETE :- To delete resource of server.
              * Removes data

              Eg:- DELETE /comment/15 -> Deletes comment with ID 15.

      6. HEAD :- To check if a resource exists, like GET but without the response body.
            * To check for performance, file  existance etc.
            
              Eg:- HEAD /product/10 -> Server checks if product exists
                    * but sends without content.

      7. OPTIONS:- To ask the server what methods are allowed for a specific resource.

              Eg:- OPTIONS/api/user
              server might responds:- 
                     Allow: GET,POST,PUT


           


                                  ◦ Structure of the Request
                                        - URL or Endpoint  
                                        - Headers  
                                        - Body  


        Answer:- When a browser send a request to server, it send complete HTTP request, which includes URL or Endpoint, headers and body.



 1) URL(Uniform Resource Locator) / Endpoint :- 
            which tells the server what resource the browser wants.



               Eg:- https://www.amazon.com/s?k=laptop&sort=price-asc-rank


               https://     :- Protocol(secure connection) using HTTPS

               www.amazon.com   :- Domain(The website) : Here we request(Amazon site)

               s       :-  Endpoint(search page) : Here it is Amazon's search page

               ?k=laptop   :- Query parameter(parameters for search and sorting) : k stands for keyword of laptop


               &sort=price-asc-rank  :- Query parameter :  sort results by price
                                                             * Low to  high




        *  This URL indicates "Search for laptops on Amazon, and show the results sorted by lowest price first."

                                       
                
        


                    How to create a URL?
-->


            <script>
               let base = "https://www.amazon.com/s";

               let searchKeyword = "laptop";

                let sortOption = "price-asc-rank";

                let finalURL = `${base}?k=${searchKeyword}&sort=${sortOption}`

               console.log(finalURL)
             </script>



<!--
2) HEADER:- 
            HTTP HEADERS are key-value pairs send with the request to give extra information to the server. 
            * Header is used to give extra or meta data.
         
            * URL tells what you want to the server. whereas,
          * Header give  extra information  to server. Informations like:-

                 - who is sending the request(Browser/device)
                 - what kind of response is expected.(HTML,JSON  etc)
                 - what session or cart you are carrying.



              Eg:-
              URL:-  https://www.amazon.com/s?k=laptop

              HEADER :-  
                     * GET /s?k=laptop HTTP/1.1     :- This means, show me search result for laptop
                     * Host:- www.amazon.com        :- This means, I'm asking Amazon's server

3) BODY  :- 
          It is the part of an HTTP request which contains actual data that the client wants to send to the server.

          * It mostly used with the method like POST,PUT, PATCH
          * It wont GET, DELETE, HEAD


          * Needs header
               Eg:-

                HEADER:- 

                    POST /signup HTTP/1.1
                    Host: www.amazon.com

                               - Body (HTML, JSON, text, etc.)  





  • What Does the Server Send Back? (HTTP Response)

   Answer:- HTTP Response is the response send back from the server after it recieves the request.
             * it will inform whether the request is success or failure,
             * what type of data is sending and
             * actual data(HTML,image,JSON etc)
   
   ◦ HTTP Response Basics  :- when thhe server recieves request, it send back the response. it has 3 parts:-
        * Parts of an HTTP Response :-
        
        

 1) Status Code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found)
             
                * This is a 3 digit number which tells whether the request is succeed or not.


| Code                        | Meaning             | Example                                |
