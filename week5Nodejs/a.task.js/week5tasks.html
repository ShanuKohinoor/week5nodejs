        ◦ Request Types (HTTP Methods)  
        ◦ Structure of the Request
               - URL or Endpoint  
               - Headers  
               - Body

        ◦ HTTP Response Basics  
        ◦ Parts of an HTTP Response  
       - Status Code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found)  
       - Headers (e.g., Content-Type)  
       - Body (HTML, JSON, text, etc.)  

    • What is an API?
    • What is Node.js?  
    • Key Features of Node.js:
    • Create a basic Node.js server using the http module that sends a plain text response
    • Create a basic HTML page with a button that fetches data from your Node server and displays it in a <div>.
    • Understand routing in Node.js and implement manual routes (/, /about, /contact) with a 404 fallback using the core http module.
Day 2 

    • What is a Package?
    • What is npm?
    • Initializing npm
        ◦ What happens when we run npm init
        ◦ What is package.json &  package-lock.json
    • What is Express?
    • Setting Up Express
    • Writing Your First Express Route
    • Create an Express server with 3 routes: /, /about, /contact.
    •  Express Routing (Deeper Dive)
        ◦ Understanding how route order affects behavior
        ◦ Different HTTP method handlers in Express (app.get, app.post, etc.)
        ◦ Handling unmatched routes (404 error handling)
        ◦ Sending different types of responses (JSON, HTML, Text)
    • Route Parameters
    • Query Parameters

Day 3 

    • Middleware in Express
        ◦ What is Middleware?
        ◦ Types of Middleware (Built-in, Application-level, Third-party)
        ◦ Order of Middleware Execution\
        ◦ Example: Custom Logging Middleware
        ◦ Using express.json() and express.urlencoded()
        ◦ Using express.static() to Serve Static Files
    • Serve static files in Express by setting up a public folder and using express.static() to access HTML, CSS, and JS files.
    • What is a Router
        ◦ Why we split routes into separate files
        ◦ Create a separate route file using express.Router()
        ◦ Export the router and import it into the main app
        ◦ Mount with app.use()

Day 4 

    • What are Modules?
    • Types of Modules
        ◦ Core Modules (like fs, path, os)
        ◦  Local Modules (your own files)
        ◦  Third-party Modules (installed via npm)
    • Using Modules (Importing & Exporting)
        ◦ Import using require() (CommonJS)
        ◦ Export using module.exports
        ◦ Intro to ES Modules (import, export) – when to use
        ◦ Difference between CommonJS and ES Modules
    • View Engine & Dynamic Rendering
        ◦ What is a View Engine & Why use it in Backend?
        ◦ Popular Options (EJS, Pug, Handlebars)
        ◦ Setting up EJS in Express
        ◦ Passing Data with res.render()
        ◦ Views Folder & .ejs Files
        ◦ Example: Render Profile Page

    • EJS + Tailwind Practice – Product Cards Page
        ◦ Passing Data with res.render()
        ◦ Create a dummy array of products (each with name, price, image).
        ◦ Use EJS to loop through the array and render product cards dynamically.
        ◦ Style the cards using Tailwind CSS in a responsive grid layout.
        ◦ Each card must show the image, name, and price.

Day 5  &   Day 6

      Login System with Predefined Credentials and Session Handling
    •  Login Page
        ◦ Create a login form using EJS.
        ◦ Input fields: username, password.
        ◦ Style the form using Tailwind CSS (centered card or form).
        ◦ On submit, POST data to /login.
    •  Server-Side Login Validation
        ◦ In /login route:
            ▪ Compare credentials with predefined values:
username = admin, password = 1234.
        ◦ If valid:
            ▪ Save session as req.session.isAuth = true
            ▪ Redirect to /home.
        ◦ If invalid:
            ▪ Re-render the login form with an error message (e.g., “Invalid credentials”).
    •  Home Page
        ◦ Only accessible when session is active (req.session.isAuth === true).
        ◦ Show a welcome message like “Welcome Admin”.
        ◦ Include a Signout button.
        ◦ Style using Tailwind CSS.
    •  Signout Route
        ◦ On clicking Signout, destroy the session and redirect to /login.
    •  Route Protection Middleware
        ◦ Create a middleware to protect /home.
        ◦ If the session is not authenticated, redirect to /login.
    •  Back Button Restriction
        ◦ After logging out, user should not be able to access /home using the browser back button.
